# FDN fixture gameplay milestone checks

Scope: the two unchanged DraftZero decks for issue #110, all their card/token
dependencies, and their custom-game rules. This is an implementation milestone.
The 286-name reference, drafting, fair Limited search and training integration
have separate milestones in `fdn_limited_implementation_v1.md`.

October 2, 19:40 UTC completion audit: CI37049183922 atd43d59a2 passed
formatting/all-feature lint and all four Python shards. Ubuntu's focused
Witness and London steps passed, including the pending bottom-menu restore
and original fixed-seed games. Windows's same London step passed at19:15:08UTC,
including the integration cases and pending bottom-menu library restore.
Full Rust remains live on both hosts. Mage PR15
atd98525a0a7c has green current-head reference and labeler checks. Kernel
PRs128 through136 are ready after complete hosted checks at their recorded
source commits; their published follow-ups change reports only. Armor's
older Windows Python failure is the timing-dependent sentinel-coverage test,
with its focused repair committed locally and passing; preserve its active
Windows Rust job110918929067 before publishing that test-only repair.

| Requirement | Scenario, action and assertion | Named checks and observed status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Both original 40-card decks load | Resolve the pinned files in original row/copy order; require 40 IDs and no unsupported names; refuse partial, unknown, no-effect and token mainboards. | `test_original_decks_are_40_cards_and_fully_resolve`; `test_cli_resolves_both_unchanged_original_decks_in_copy_order`; `test_unknown_partial_no_effect_and_token_are_all_rejected`. CLI resolution passed on October 2. |
| Natural external games | Send original decks through the real schema-4 subprocess; player zero mulligans once and player one twice; bottom four cards total before play; require a natural terminal under the safety cap. | `original_fixtures_play_with_london_in_both_seats_and_replay_exactly`: seed 123 twice and swapped seed 701 passed on Ubuntu and Windows. |
| Deterministic replay | Run identical input, seed and actions twice; compare the complete transcript and terminal exactly. | Same original-fixture test; SHA-256/input/terminal receipts are printed by the CI command. Ubuntu and Windows passed. |
| Pending decision restore | Snapshot every pregame phase and a live private bottom menu; preserve choices, binding, RNG, incarnation and the resulting state; reject stale or foreign choices atomically. | `restore_each_pregame_phase_reproduces_choices_rng_and_zone_incarnations` and the internal pending-bottom session test passed on Ubuntu and Windows. `pending_assignment_rejects_priority_and_restores_exactly` covers combat. |
| Required card/rules behavior | Exercise costs, targets, loss of targets, triggers, tokens, layers, attachments and combat; validate all earlier session/protocol identities. | CI has 24 Witness cases, 11 London integration cases, the London session restore, 19 earlier Limited integration targets, library/RL/profile tests and default/native/CUDA checks. Complete corrected-source CI remains pending. |
| Relevant XMage comparisons | Execute London and FDN card positions plus arbitrary damage allocation, trample, deathtouch and first/double strike. Require every selected XML report with no failures/errors/skips. | Mage run 37049882555 at 5cc4decd8ffe passed all 146 cases in all 16 selected classes, with zero failures/errors/skips. Includes four strict combat allocation cases, 24 existing combat cases, seven London cases and 111 earlier FDN card cases. Source/output hashes and XML counts independently verified. Mage PR #15 carries the reference suite. |
| Reviewable delivery | Commit changes in owned branches, preserve the stacks and get required checks green. | Kernel PR #139 and Mage PR #15 carry the final batches. Source is committed; review and complete CI remain pending. |

Fresh inventory: 39 unique original fixture names fully resolve. The wider
286-name reference has 43 full, one partial and 242 missing names. Required
token definitions are Elf Warrior, Knight, Faerie, Homunculus Horde, Koma's
Coil, Scion of the Deep and Raccoon. The Limited catalog has 206 definitions
and v49 hash `3eee8a1cbc874e18`; default v32 remains `64c82a261e078f1a`.

Pinned original deck SHA-256s:

- UG: `bb618d6eaddf04b0a9e51e9a88cd512a04635e99ebca91b11ace4c305d634c86`
- WG: `be026f1c86e3aabcb294517188d0c5f4f0cdfa3c5e95ee9dedfc51d3cdf814f7`

CI 37038033614 passed all 19 Limited integration targets on Ubuntu, then
seven session tests and 66 RL session tests. Its next library target found a
stale expected catalog count of 205 rather than 206, with 45 other card-definition
tests passing. Corrected that assertion without changing the catalog or its
identity. Complete verification of the corrected source remains required.

Both PCs' other owners retain their resource reservations. All heavy Rust
and Java compilation uses hosted CI. These checks are bounded CPU correctness
checks, with no new training, paid compute or playing-strength claim.
