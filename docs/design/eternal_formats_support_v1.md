# Pauper, Legacy and Vintage card support

Status: design, 2026-10-26, revised after an adversarial review (Fable, same day; all six
required changes applied). Codex's FDN work (#110, PR #308) is unaffected.

## Goal and measure

"Support a format" means the kernel can play the decks people actually play in it. The
measure is the **playable metagame share**: the summed metagame percentage of archetypes
whose whole mainboard, and companion if the deck has one, is Full in the `eternal-fixtures`
build. Best-of-one mainboards come first, as in the roadmap; sideboards follow once a
format's mainboards are playable.

`python/tools/eternal_meta_census_v1.py` computes it from a committed snapshot
(`data/eternal_v1/meta_snapshot_mtggoldfish_20261026.json`: 153 archetypes, one
representative MTGGoldfish paper list each, with the companion named where a sideboard
holds one). The snapshot is refreshed when the metagame moves, and each wave's PR reports
the census before and after.

## Baseline (snapshot 2026-10-26, eternal build with an empty eternal registry)

| Format | Archetypes | Distinct cards | Full | FDN only | Missing | Playable share |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Pauper | 60 | 535 | 173 | 4 | 358 | 20.9% |
| Legacy | 60 | 563 | 62 | 1 | 500 | 0% |
| Vintage | 33 | 427 | 38 | 1 | 388 | 0% |
| All three | | 1,225 | 200 | 6 | 1,019 | |

"Full" counts the Pauper and Standard registries. "FDN only" cards have a program that has
to be copied into the eternal registry. Completing decks greedily by share per new card
needs these card counts (companions not yet required in this count):

| Format | 50% of field | 75% | 90% |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Pauper | 13 | 76 | 148 |
| Legacy | 95 | 181 | 277 |
| Vintage | 82 | 111 | 154 |

Legacy and Vintage share most staples, so the joint count is lower than the sum. About
37% of the Vintage field plays Lurrus as a companion, so Vintage's curve depends on
companion support.

## Catalog

All three formats share one build, `eternal-fixtures`. Its registry is the frozen 192-card
Pauper prefix, then the Standard registry unchanged, then `data/eternal_v1/cards_v1.json`.

- The feature enables `standard-magezero-fixtures` (and through it FDN rules code), as
  Standard enables FDN. Every Standard card keeps its id and program; the catalog hash
  differs (`kernel_carddb_eternal/v1`), so Standard identity tests are gated off in this
  build while the rest of the Standard suite runs on it in CI.
- The default Pauper build, its hash and every frozen store are unchanged. New Pauper cards
  go in the eternal file, since the Pauper registry is frozen.
- Eternal ids follow the 254 Standard definitions; the catalog test pins that count. A
  Standard append would shift eternal ids, which is acceptable only before the first
  eternal model trains. The eternal hash is pinned in a test once CI first reports it.
- FDN-only cards are copied into the eternal file. Some FDN programs are compiled only when
  `standard-magezero-fixtures` is off, so a copy could stay flagged Full with no behavior.
  Every copy therefore ships with a rules test compiled under `eternal-fixtures`, and the
  FDN cards gated that way (Herald of Eternal Dawn, Bloodthirsty Conqueror, Twinflame
  Tyrant, Elenda, Heraldic Banner, Ajani, Dwynen) are not copied until their gate is
  widened.

## Work order

Waves are ordered by share gained per card. Each wave is one PR (one coherent deliverable),
built and tested on hosted CI or under a HaleysPC reservation while the desktop is
reserved.

| Wave | Content | New cards | Result |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| E0 | Feature, empty eternal registry, catalog test, session games, CI group, census | 0 | Infrastructure |
| E1 | Pauper close-ins: Mono-Red Madness, Rally, Grixis Affinity, Dimir Faeries, Grixis and Dimir Control | 14 | Pauper 21% to about 53% |
| E2 | Legacy Dimir Tempo and Izzet Delver: original duals, surveil lands, fetchlands, Wasteland, Force of Will, Daze, Thoughtseize, Fatal Push, Unholy Heat, Prismari Charm, the Baubles, Brazen Borrower, Dragon's Rage Channeler, Murktide Regent, Moonshadow, Nethergoyf, Orcish Bowmasters, Tamiyo, Bilbo | 27 and a token | Legacy 0% to 19.3% |
| E3 | Legacy decks greedily: Doomsday, Sneak and Show, Aluren, Eldrazi, Boros Energy, then the remaining staples (Strip Mine, Negation, Mental Misstep, Swords, Dismember) | about 95 | Legacy about 50% |
| E4 | Vintage Jewel Shops and Mono-White Initiative: Power Nine (with Mana Crypt, Mana Vault and Sol Ring), Workshop, Academy, Strip Mine, Karakas, Urza's Saga, Time Vault, Tinker, Karn, Tezzeret, Phyrexian Metamorph, Coveted Jewel, Trinisphere, the Initiative creatures, Archon of Emeria, Clarion Conqueror, Chancellor of the Annex, Anointed Peacekeeper, Witch Enchanter; six shared cards come from E3 | 36 | Vintage 0% to 28.4% once E3 lands |
| E4b | Vintage: Raker Shops, then companions and the Lurrus lists | about 45 | Vintage about 50% |
| E5 | Pauper to 90%, Legacy and Vintage to 75%, then sideboards | about 350 | |

## Rules primitives

Derived from the missing cards of each wave's decks. Already in the engine and reused:
extra turns, initiative and dungeons, monarch, Phyrexian mana, delve, planeswalkers,
Sagas, transform, temporary control, flashback, affinity, ninjutsu, kicker, madness.

New, each built once in the first wave that needs it:

- E1: energy counters; replicate; cast-from-graveyard conditions (Plunder the Trollshaws);
  karoo lands; two-target spells. Built in `src/eternal_cards_v1.rs` and
  `build_eternal_v1.rs`: energy is `GameState::eternal_v1` with the
  `CostComponent::PayEnergyV1` cost; replicate announces its payment count like X and
  adds one cast trigger that copies the spell per payment; `StandardTargetV1::TwoCreaturesV1`
  lets two target words name one creature; `ManaAbilityAmountDef::FixedColorsV1` adds a
  fixed color bundle; the karoo return is a land choice on resolution.
- E2, built in `src/eternal_cards_v1.rs` and `build_eternal_v1.rs`: original duals use
  the existing two-type land mana; `LibraryCardFilter::CardWithAnySubtypeV1` lets
  fetchlands find any card with either land type; alternative costs that return a
  permanent (Daze) or exile a colored card from hand (Force of Will,
  `CostComponent::ExileCardFromHandWithColorV1`) are staged like other cast object
  costs; Nethergoyf's escape exiles cards until four card types are covered
  (`CostComponent::ExileOtherGraveyardCardsWithCardTypesV1`); delayed upkeep draws
  and Tamiyo's "until your next turn" attack trigger are delayed triggers owned by
  their source; delirium, revolt and Bowmasters' first-draw exception read live state
  or event history; planeswalker back faces enter with their loyalty; Bilbo casts from
  the graveyard through the resolution-cast path with costs paid. Moxen, Lotus,
  restricted mana and seeded coin flips move to E4.
- E3: storm as a general keyword (today it is keyed to Weather the Storm), Thassa's Oracle
  and Doomsday library construction, Show and Tell's simultaneous choice, free-cast
  permissions (Sneak Attack, Aluren, Omniscience), Chalice of the Void, Misdirection
  retargeting, Emrakul (cast trigger, annihilator, protection), naming a card (Pithing
  Needle, Disruptor Flute, Cavern of Souls), "can't be activated" and cost-tax statics
  (Null Rod, Trinisphere, Thalia).
- E4, built in `src/eternal_vintage_v1.rs` and `build_eternal_vintage_v1.rs`: fixed
  multi-mana rocks use the conditional tap yield (Tolarian Academy adds nothing without
  an artifact); Black Lotus and Coveted Jewel are rich mana abilities; Mana Crypt flips a
  seeded coin; Workshop's mana becomes restricted units only artifact spells spend
  (`ManaSpendRestrictionDef::ArtifactSpellV1`); Time Walk joins Temporal Manipulation's
  extra-turn scheduler and Time Vault's ability is scheduled the same way, while Time
  Vault's skip is chosen at the end step before its controller's turn and applied when
  that turn would begin; "doesn't untap" for both Vaults; Coveted Jewel's unblocked-attack
  trigger and Mana Vault's draw-step trigger are queued by engine hooks; Vexing Bauble and
  Void Mirror read the mana each cast spent; Trinisphere raises a spell's total to three;
  Archon of Emeria's cast limit and tapped nonbasic lands; Clarion Conqueror and Karn's
  "can't be activated" statics; Karn's wish finds nothing outside the game in
  best-of-one mainboard sessions and so chooses only from exile; Urza's Saga gains its
  chapter abilities; Phyrexian Metamorph enters as a copy the way Assimilation Aegis
  copies; Witch Enchanter's land face is a modal land drop with a pay-3-life choice;
  Anointed Peacekeeper names any registry card by letter, then name; Chancellor of the
  Annex's opening-hand reveal is offered as the game's first upkeep begins. Companions
  (reveal, pay 3, put into hand) and Lurrus's graveyard casting move to E4b.

## Card contract and verification

Each card follows the existing contract: `engine_capability` Full only when every
reachable branch is implemented, a typed program (no name-only behavior), and a native
rules test for every new card (not only per family), modeled on `tests/standard/*`. Every
wave also adds:

- The newly playable decks to `PLAYABLE` in `tests/eternal/eternal_catalog_v1.rs`, which
  resolves them, preflights them and plays each against the next with a ranked action
  preference and with seeded random actions (so lands, mana rocks and activated abilities
  run), checking natural terminals and transcript replay. A deck with a companion stays
  out of `PLAYABLE` until companions are supported and the test exercises the companion.
- The census output, before and after, in the PR description.

Gameplay support is engineering, not playing-strength evidence. Policy encoders, training
and Spellbench entries for eternal formats are separate work; frozen Pauper encoders keep
refusing unsupported state.

## Execution

Family workers implement bounded card groups in their own worktrees; one integrator owns
cross-family repairs, CI and the wave PR. No local build runs while `host_slots` shows the
desktop claimed. Cards absent from the local XMage data (59, mostly 2026 sets) take Oracle
text from Scryfall at implementation time.

Out of scope here: cards outside the snapshot (a later Oracle-template generator can cover
vanilla and templated cards), Commander-only mechanics, and model work.
