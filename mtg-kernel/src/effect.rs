//! Interpreted effect programs.
//!
//! `EffectOp` is the only representation of card behavior: composition
//! primitives (`Sequence`, `Conditional`, `Choice`) plus a fixed
//! leaf-op vocabulary (`DealDamage`, `DrawCards`, `MoveObject`, library
//! partitioning, token creation, and other reusable state transitions).
//! There is no card-shaped op --
//! "Lightning Bolt" is not a variant, `DealDamage { amount: 3, .. }` is
//! (see `card_def.rs` / the generated `CARD_DEFS` table for how card
//! behavior handlers are wired up).
//!
//! `execute` and the resumable interpreter are the only paths that run an
//! `EffectOp`, and every leaf mutation goes through `event::propose_and_commit`
//! or `event::propose_and_commit_batch`, so nothing but the commit pipeline
//! (`event::commit`) mutates `GameState` in response to card behavior (see the
//! crate-level invariants in `lib.rs`).
