"""Core slots beside the host reservation (v1): untimed work uses the cores timed work leaves free.

host_reservation_v1.py (mtg-kernel python/tools) reserves a whole host with
one lock file, <root>/<HOST>.lock. This module never writes that lock and
never changes what it means. It keeps its own records beside it, under
<root>/<HOST>.slots/:

- Timed work that holds the v1 reservation may give back the cores it does
  not need. `timed --cores 0-7 -- CMD`, run inside the v1 supervisor (so
  MTG_HOST_RESERVATION_TOKEN names the held lock), pins CMD and all its
  descendants to those cores. While CMD runs, it declares them in
  share-<token hash>.json. A reservation acquired with `--cores SPEC`
  records its cores in the lock itself, and those count from the moment
  the lock exists (before `timed` starts and after it ends). Without either,
  a held v1 lock still reserves the whole host, exactly as before.
- Untimed work runs as `run --cores N [--wait] -- CMD`. It claims N cores
  that no declaration and no other claim holds. It pins CMD and all its
  descendants to those cores at the configured priority (below normal by
  default), and it frees the cores once the whole process tree has ended.
  Whenever a held v1 lock leaves the claim no room, every process in the
  claim is suspended until the room comes back. A lock leaves no room when
  it has no declaration, or when its declaration overlaps the claim's
  cores. Timed work therefore never shares a core with untimed work.
- With `--wait`, a claim joins the queue, and queued claims start in
  arrival order as cores free up. `submit` starts a detached waiting `run`
  and returns at once.
- Backfill: a request that declares `--max-seconds S` may start before the
  queue head when it fits in free cores now (never a background claim's) and
  cannot delay the head, under every order in which the live claims could end
  (at most 12 claims, never while a timed reservation is held, and only when
  the head was queued under the current config). A request that could delay
  the head may still start when the head declared its own --max-seconds H
  and every such delaying backfill for that head fits in one window (first
  start to last deadline) of at most min(15 minutes, H / 10); none starts
  while an earlier one is overdue. Only the first eligible request behind
  the head starts, and only ordinary requests behind an ordinary head. S is
  at most 30 days.
- Any claim with --max-seconds S is handled by its own runner once S has
  passed (--on-overdue): flag (default) only marks it; demote (opt-in)
  republishes it as background work that ordinary claims and timed holds
  may suspend; kill (opt-in) ends its own job's processes outside the
  admission mutex (never the runner, never another claim). A flag request
  carries backfill_policy 0 and never gets a delaying backfill.
- Shared claims (`run --shared --cores N --min-cores M`): the claim guarantees
  M cores and lends the rest of its current cores. A later claim may take a
  lent core; the shared claim narrows its job's affinity before it republishes
  its cores, and the later claim starts only after that (as with background
  claims). Lenders also give cores back to keep occupied cores within the
  budget (configured minus keep_free), give back every lent core while any
  request is queued, and grow onto cores no claim runs on only while nothing
  is queued. While it lends, a deliberately unreadable delay-lending-<id>.json
  stops every backfill engine at or after c543e1b4 (mtg-kernel e2657b8c,
  #427). Older engines (#407) ignore it, so shared claims are off on a host
  until its config says "lending": true, which the deploy sets only once no
  older copy can queue there. Never for timing work.
- `--core-pool` is a hard restriction and needs `--pool-reason` (POOL_REASONS).
- `status` prints the timed reservation (lane, work and declared cores),
  the claims, the queue and the free cores. It never prints the token.
- `watch` samples per-CPU use and the records, logs to <root>/<HOST>.util/,
  flags low use and queued requests beside unclaimed cores, and nudges;
  it never changes a claim. `watch-report` sums its logs and the runners'
  admit/end events.
  `topology` lists the logical CPUs with each core's efficiency class:
  hybrid Intel P cores rank above E cores.

Background jobs (`run --background` or Windows `adopt --background`) yield
to both timed reservations and ordinary claims. Ordinary admission waits
for complete suspension before using borrowed CPUs. Background tickets
come after every ordinary ticket. OS --priority is independent of this
allocation class; CI uses --background --priority idle. `adopt` watches a
verified existing worker and all descendants until its job object empties.
Idle CI listeners do not need a claim.

Optional per-host config, <root>/<HOST>.slots/config.json:
  {"cores": "23-0", "keep_free": 0, "priority": "below_normal", "ci_floor": 0}
"ci_floor" reserves the last that many cores in preference order for background
(CI) claims, which try them first; no other claim takes them.
"cores" lists the cores untimed work may use, in order of preference. The
default is every logical CPU, highest-numbered first, so claims stay off the
low-numbered cores (P cores on hybrid Intel) that timed work usually
declares. "keep_free" is how many of those cores are never handed out, for
the owner of a shared machine. "priority" is the default for claims, one of
normal, below_normal or idle.

Containment: on Windows, each claim (and each timed declaration) runs in a
job object. The job kills every member when its runner exits, sets the
affinity of the whole tree, and for claims also sets the priority class of
the whole tree. On Linux the claim runs in its own session. Affinity and
nice values are inherited, and suspension uses SIGSTOP/SIGCONT on that
process group, so a process that leaves the group escapes. Linux is
supported for WSL runners and tests; Windows is the production platform.

    claim's cores, so it never suspends one.
    Only ordinary requests backfill, behind an ordinary head: later ordinary requests overtake a
